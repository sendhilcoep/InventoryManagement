#Inventory Management Application

An organization maintains an internal inventory for resources to be provided to the employees like basic stationery, Coffee Mugs etc.
This application provides interfaces for employees to make an order. Administrator privileges are given to certain users who are notified when the resources are out of stock or understocked.
